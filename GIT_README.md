# Sanskrit Programming Language (संस्कृत-प्रोग्रामिङ्-भाषा)

A revolutionary programming language that integrates Sanskrit principles with modern computing concepts, featuring sound-based computation and multi-paradigm support.

## Features

### 1. Sound-Based Computing (शब्द-गणना)
- Sanskrit syllables map directly to assembly instructions
- Sound patterns generate optimized code
- Vibration-based memory management
- Harmonic optimization

### 2. Multi-Paradigm Support (बहु-पद्धति-समर्थनम्)
- Functional programming through mantras
- Object-oriented concepts through sound patterns
- Declarative programming through sound relationships
- Direct assembly integration

### 3. Fractal Computation (सूक्ष्म-बृहत्-गणना)
- Scale between quantum and classical levels
- Pattern-based computation
- Harmonic relationships
- Resource optimization

### 4. Quantum Integration (क्वान्टम-समन्वयः)
- Quantum state management
- Quantum-classical bridging
- Sound-based quantum operations
- Harmonic state transitions
