1. Academic adoption
2. Industry partnerships
3. Tool ecosystem growth
4. International standardization
5. Cross-platform support
6. Cloud integration
7. Mobile development support

## Proposed Folder Structure and Additional Documentation
To organize these tasks in a more detailed manner, we can adopt a folder structure like:

```
sanskrit_programming/
├── docs/
│   ├── concept/
│   │   └── sanskrit_programming_concept.md
│   └── roadmap/
│       └── sanskrit_programming_implementation_roadmap.md
└── tasks/
    ├── phase1_tasks.md
    ├── phase2_tasks.md
    └── ...
```

- The "docs" folder holds high-level documents, split into subfolders (e.g., "concept" and "roadmap").
- A "tasks" folder can house detailed breakdowns of each phase (like "phase1_tasks.md") to elaborate on individual sub-tasks.
- These per-phase files can reference the relevant bullet points from the roadmap, ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of deliverables and progress tracking.
