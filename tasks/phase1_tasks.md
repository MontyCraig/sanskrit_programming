# Phase 1 Tasks: Foundation and Research

This document provides more detailed steps for each sub-task listed in Phase 1 of the "Sanskrit Programming Language Implementation Roadmap."

## 1.1 Establish core team of Sanskrit scholars and computer scientists
- Identify academic institutions and industry experts in Sanskrit linguistics.
- Shortlist experienced computer scientists with compiler or language design backgrounds.
- Schedule initial kick-off meetings to define high-level strategy.

## 1.2 Conduct comprehensive review of Sanskrit grammar systems
- Gather primary references such as पाणिनीय व्याकरण.
- Compare alternative grammar interpretations and historical notes.
- Summarize findings and create a reference guide for language design decisions.

## 1.3 Research existing programming language implementations
- Study modern and historical language design approaches (e.g., C, Lisp, Rust).
- Compile best practices for lexical analysis, parsing, and runtime architecture.
- Document relevant insights on performance, typing systems, and error handling.

## 1.4 Define formal grammar specification requirements
- Use insights from (1.2) and (1.3) to pin down must-have grammar features.
- Outline the scope of the language grammar (e.g., Devanagari support, case system).
- Document relevant constraints and preliminary acceptance criteria.

## 1.5 Document initial language design principles
- Articulate the core philosophy (precision, naturalness, elegance).
- Clarify how Sanskrit grammar influences variable declarations, function definitions, etc.
- Decide on the balance between Sanskrit purity and practical CS needs.

## 1.6 Create preliminary syntax specifications
- Draft early syntax examples (variable declarations, functions, control structures).
- Circulate among team members for feedback and refinement.
- Establish a preliminary style guide for code formatting in Devanagari script.

## Next Steps
At the end of Phase 1, the team should have a well-defined foundation, including:
- A core group of contributors.
- A reference library of Sanskrit grammar details.
- A comparative analysis of existing programming languages.
- Draft specifications and guiding principles for the Sanskrit Programming Language.
