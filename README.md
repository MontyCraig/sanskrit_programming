# Sanskrit Programming Language (संस्कृत प्रोग्रामिंग भाषा)

## About

The Sanskrit Programming Language is a groundbreaking project that bridges ancient wisdom with modern computing. By integrating Sanskrit's precise grammatical structure, rich semantics, and sound-based principles with contemporary programming paradigms, we're creating a unique computational framework that offers:

- **Sound-Based Computing**: Leveraging Sanskrit phonetics for program execution and memory management
- **Multi-Paradigm Integration**: Combining functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches through Sanskrit principles
- **Quantum-Classical Bridge**: Using Sanskrit's unified approach to connect quantum and classical computing
- **Fractal Computation**: Enabling seamless scaling between micro (quantum) and macro (classical) operations
- **NASA-Inspired Architecture**: Incorporating reliability and safety principles from space-grade software

## Getting Started

Documentation is organized as follows:
1. Start with `docs/concept/sanskrit_programming_concept.md` for the language philosophy
2. Review `docs/roadmap/sanskrit_programming_implementation_roadmap.md` for development plans
3. Check `tasks/` directory for detailed phase-wise task breakdowns
